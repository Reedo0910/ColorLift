## Interface Preview

![Application Interface](images/promote_en_2.png)

**Supports switching between HEX, RGB, and HSL color formats.**

*(The language model used in the demonstration is Claude 3.5 Sonnet.)*


## System Requirements

- Windows 7 or later
- macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or later

## Supported LLMs

ColorLift supports the following language models:

- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5 Series
- **Cohere**: Command R Series
- **iFlytek Spark**: Lite, Pro, Max, 4.0 Ultra
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o Series
- **Zhipu AI**: GLM-4 Series

*Due to differences in underlying architecture and training data, the quality of text generated by different language models may vary.*

## Notes

- This application is a free, open-source tool. However, using language model APIs may incur fees charged by respective providers. Please refer to their pricing documentation for details.
- All color descriptions and recommendations are generated by AI. Verify critical information to ensure accuracy.
- **This tool is not intended for precise color measurement or professional color guidance.**

## Preparation Before Use

Before using ColorLift, ensure you have an API Key from a supported large language model (LLM) provider. Here are the supported providers and their API Key acquisition links (registration required):

- **Anthropic**: [Get API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard) | [Pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing#anthropic-api)
- **Cohere**: [Get API Key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys) | [Pricing](https://cohere.ai/pricing)
- **iFlytek Spark**: [Get API Key](https://console.xfyun.cn/services) (Obtain the API Password in the HTTP service interface authentication section under the specific model) | [Pricing](https://xinghuo.xfyun.cn/sparkapi?scr=price)
- **OpenAI**: [Get API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) | [Pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing/)
- **Zhipu AI**: [Get API Key](https://open.bigmodel.cn/usercenter/proj-mgmt/apikeys) (Account Settings > Project Management > API Keys) | [Pricing](https://open.bigmodel.cn/pricing)

## How to Use

1. In the settings section at the bottom-right corner of the main interface, select your LLM provider and model, and enter the API Key from the respective provider (ensure your region and network allow access to the model service).
2. Use the color picker tool on the interface (or use the default shortcuts: Windows: `Alt + D` / macOS: `Option + C`) to select any color from the screen.
3. ColorLift will generate the following information:
   - HEX, RGB, and HSL color values.
   - A detailed textual description, including a description of the color and its common applications.
4. Copy the color code and description with a single click.


## Issues macOS Users Might Encounter

### Security Warning When Launching for the First Time After Installation/Update

Since ColorLift has not yet enabled code signing (as this is a hobby-driven personal project and the annual fee for an Apple Developer account has not been paid), macOS may trigger a security warning the first time you run the app. Follow these steps to set it up for normal use:

- **macOS with Apple M-series chip**:

   Open "Terminal" (press `Command+Space`, search for "Terminal"), then enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```bash
   sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ColorLift.app
   ```

- **macOS with Intel chip**:

   Please refer to Apple's official documentation: [Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac).

### Why Does System Settings Show That ColorLift Has "Screen Recording and System Audio" Permission, But It Still Prompts for Permission? (Or Why Can't I Pick Colors Properly?)

**This issue often occurs after updating the application. You need to reset ColorLift's system permissions:**

(macOS 15.0 and above) Please navigate to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording and System Audio**, select **ColorLift**, and click the **minus (-) button** in the lower left corner to remove ColorLift. Then, use ColorLift to pick a color. At this point, ColorLift will reappear in the list. Finally, enable the permissions for ColorLift in the list.

Steps and interface wording might vary slightly on other macOS versions.

### Why Is Updating the App So Tedious?

This is because ColorLift currently does not have code signing enabled. Each time you install (or update) the app, macOS treats it as a brand-new program and does not recognize previously granted permissions.

If the automatic update process causes inconvenience, you can disable "Check for updates on app launch" in settings. Instead, manually check for updates via the "About" window or download the latest version from the [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/Reedo0910/ColorLift/releases).


## Privacy

1. **Screen Access**:

   - On macOS, ColorLift requires screen recording and system audio permissions to function. Without these permissions, the color picker may not work properly.
   - During color picking, the application only reads the color value of a 1x1 pixel area under the cursor and sends the HEX, RGB, and HSL values to the LLM for processing (designed to protect privacy and minimize API usage costs).

2. **LLM API Key**:

   - Your API Key is stored locally and is used solely for calling the corresponding model service.

## FAQ

1. **Unable to pick colors from certain areas (e.g., menu bars or icons)?**
   Use the shortcut keys (Windows: `Alt + D` / macOS: `Option + C`) to pick colors from the desired area instead of clicking directly.

2. **Linux support?**
   ColorLift, built on Electron, theoretically supports Linux. However, due to the lack of a suitable development environment, Linux packages are not provided. Contributions are welcome.

3. **Mobile system support?**
   ColorLift does not support mobile OS. However, you can use screen mirroring tools (e.g., *[iPhone Mirroring](https://support.apple.com/120421)* on macOS) to pick colors from mobile screens.

4. **Automatic updates?**
   Due to budget constraints, ColorLift does not utilize code signing. According to Electron's official limitations, unsigned applications cannot provide automatic update services on macOS. Currently, ColorLift checks for updates in the background when the app starts, but users need to manually download and install the update files. You can also disable app updates in the settings and manually check for updates in the About window, or directly download the latest version from the [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/Reedo0910/ColorLift/releases).

5. **Color picking accuracy?**
   The color picker retrieves the color value of a single pixel from a screenshot. While accurate for most scenarios, slight deviations may occur in extreme cases. This deviation is negligible for descriptions but not suitable for professional color measurement.

6. **Requests for additional features/models/settings?**
   To keep the application simple and user-friendly, additional complex features (e.g., region picking, color history) or support for new models will only be considered if they offer significant advantages over existing ones.

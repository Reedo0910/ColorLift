## Preparation Before Use

Before using ColorLift, ensure you have an API Key from a supported large language model (LLM) provider. Here are the supported providers and their API Key acquisition links (registration and login required):

- **Anthropic**: [Get API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard) | [Pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing#anthropic-api)
- **Cohere**: [Get API Key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys) | [Pricing](https://cohere.ai/pricing)
- **iFlytek Spark**: [Get API Key](https://console.xfyun.cn/services) (Obtain the API Password in the HTTP service interface authentication section under the specific model) | [Pricing](https://xinghuo.xfyun.cn/sparkapi?scr=price)
- **OpenAI**: [Get API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) | [Pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing/)
- **Zhipu AI**: [Get API Key](https://open.bigmodel.cn/usercenter/proj-mgmt/apikeys) (Account Settings > Project Management > API Keys) | [Pricing](https://open.bigmodel.cn/pricing)

### macOS Users: Initial Setup Notice

Since ColorLift does not currently use code signing (as this is a personal project without an Apple Developer Account), running it for the first time on macOS may trigger a security warning. You can follow simple steps to enable it. Refer to the official guide: [Open a Mac App from an Unidentified Developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac).

## How to Use

1. In the settings section at the bottom-right corner of the main interface, select your LLM provider and model, and enter the API Key from the respective provider (ensure your region and network allow access to the model service).
2. Use the color picker tool on the interface (or use the default shortcuts: Windows: `Alt + D` / macOS: `Option + C`) to select any color from the screen.
3. ColorLift will generate the following information:
   - HEX color value.
   - A detailed textual description, including a description of the color and its common applications. For example:
     > *(Generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet)*
     > `#5B8FB0`:
     > A sophisticated blue-gray hue with a touch of deep-sea mystique. It resembles the sky reflected on a calm sea, balancing indigo and gray, exuding maturity and stability. This color is commonly used in modern minimalist interior design, ideal for bedroom or study walls to create a serene and cozy ambiance. It’s also popular in corporate branding, conveying professionalism and reliability. Additionally, it frequently appears in business attire, high-end furniture, and architectural facades, showcasing understated elegance.
4. Copy the color code and description with a single click.

## Privacy

1. **Screen Access**:

   - On macOS, ColorLift requires screen recording and system audio permissions to function. Without these permissions, the color picker may not work properly.
   - During color picking, the application only reads the color value of a 1x1 pixel area under the cursor and sends the HEX value to the LLM for processing (designed to protect privacy and minimize API usage costs).

2. **LLM API Key**:

   - Your API Key is stored locally and is used solely for calling the corresponding model service.

## Supported LLMs

ColorLift supports the following language models:

- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5 Series
- **Cohere**: Command R Series
- **iFlytek Spark**: Lite, Pro, Max, 4.0 Ultra
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o Series
- **Zhipu AI**: GLM-4 Series

## FAQ

1. **Unable to pick colors from certain areas (e.g., menu bars or icons)?**
   Use the shortcut keys (Windows: `Alt + D` / macOS: `Option + C`) to pick colors from the desired area instead of clicking directly.

2. **macOS permissions issue despite granting screen recording access?**
   For macOS 15.0 and above: Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording > Select ColorLift > Click the “-” button to remove ColorLift from the list > Restart ColorLift and grant permissions again.

3. **Linux support?**
   ColorLift, built on Electron, theoretically supports Linux. However, due to the lack of a suitable development environment, Linux packages are not provided. Contributions are welcome.

4. **Mobile system support?**
   ColorLift does not support mobile OS. However, you can use screen mirroring tools (e.g., *[iPhone Mirroring](https://support.apple.com/120421)* on macOS) to pick colors from mobile screens.

5. **Automatic updates?**
   Due to the lack of code signing, automatic updates are not supported on macOS. Check for updates manually via the About window or download the latest version from the [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/Reedo0910/ColorLift/releases).

6. **Rendering issues on Windows/macOS?**
   Window rendering issues may occur during window resizing or theme switching. Restart the application to resolve the issue.

7. **Color picking accuracy?**
   The color picker retrieves the color value of a single pixel from a screenshot. While accurate for most scenarios, slight deviations may occur in extreme cases. This deviation is negligible for descriptions but not suitable for professional color measurement.

8. **Requests for additional features/models/settings?**
   To keep the application simple and user-friendly, additional complex features (e.g., region picking, color history) or support for new models will only be considered if they offer significant advantages over existing ones.
